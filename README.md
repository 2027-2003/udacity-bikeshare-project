# Ford GoBike Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes data from the Ford GoBike bike-sharing system in the US.  
The focus is on understanding patterns of bike usage from the dataset provided for **February 2019**.  
Through this analysis, we explore user behavior, trip durations, popular stations, and demographic information.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information about individual rides made in the bike-sharing system covering:
- Trip duration
- Start and end stations
- User type (Subscriber or Customer)
- Gender
- Birth year

The dataset was provided by Udacity and contains data from the **Ford GoBike system**.
